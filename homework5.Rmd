```{r}
pokemon <- read_csv("data/Pokemon.csv")
head(pokemon)
```

# Exercise 1
```{r}
pokemon <- pokemon %>% 
  clean_names()
head(pokemon)
```
1. What happened to the data? 
  Column names are cleaned. For example, column name has changed from "#" to "number" and all the uppercase letters became lowercase letters. Also, it removes unnecessary spaces and replaces "." to "_".
  
2. why is clean_names() useful?
  It cleans dirty data and make it easier to process data.

# Exercise 2
```{r}
pokemon %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = type_1)) +
  geom_bar()

table(pokemon$type_1)
unique(pokemon$type_1)

# filtered_pokemon <- filter(pokemon, type_1 == "Bug" | type_1 == "Fire" | type_1 == "Grass" | type_1 == "Normal" | type_1 == "Water" | type_1 == "Psychic")

df <- pokemon %>%
  filter(type_1 %in% c("Bug", "Fire", "Grass", "Normal", "Water", "Psychic"))
df

# Converting "type_1" and "legendary" to factors
df$type_1 <- factor(df$type_1)
df$legendary <- factor(df$legendary)
```
1. How many classes of outcome are there? 
  There are 18 classes.
2. Are there any Pokemon types with very few Pokemon? Which ones?
  "Flying" has only 4.

# Exercise 3
```{r}
set.seed(1014)

df_split <- initial_split(df, prop = 0.70,
                          strata = type_1)
df_train <- training(df_split)
df_test <- testing(df_split)

dim(df_train)
dim(df_test)

df_folds <- vfold_cv(df_train, v = 5, strata = type_1)
df_folds
```
1. Number of observations for training and test sets?
  318 observations for train sets and 140 observations for test sets.
2. Why stratifying the folds be useful?
  If we do not split the data into different sets the model would be evaluated on the same data it has seen during training. We could avoid overfitting by stratifying sampling.

# Exercise 4
```{r}
df_recipe <- recipe(type_1 ~ legendary + generation + sp_atk + attack + speed + defense + hp + sp_def, 
                   data = df_train) %>%
  step_dummy(c(legendary, generation)) %>%
  step_normalize(all_predictors())
```

# Exercise 5
```{r}
tune_engine <- multinom_reg(penalty = tune(), mixture = tune()) %>% 
  set_mode("classification") %>%
  set_engine("glmnet")

pokemon_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(tune_engine) %>%
  add_recipe(df_recipe)

penalty_grid <- grid_regular(penalty(range = c(-5,5)), mixture(range = c(0,1)), levels = 10)
```
1. How many total models will you be fitting when you fit these models to your folded data?
  500 models

# Exercise 6
```{r}
tune_res <- tune_grid(
  pokemon_wf,
  resamples = df_folds,
  grid = penalty_grid
)

autoplot(tune_res)
```

# Exercise 7
```{r}
best_penalty <- select_best(tune_res, metrix = "roc_auc")
final <- finalize_workflow(pokemon_wf, best_penalty)

final_fit <- fit(final, data = df_train)

predict(final_fit, new_data = df_test, type = "class")

test_acc <- augment(final_fit, new_data = df_test) %>%
  accuracy(truth = type_1, estimate = .pred_class)

test_acc
```

# Exercise 8
```{r}
augment(final_fit, new_data = df_test) %>%
  roc_auc(type_1, .pred_Bug, .pred_Fire, .pred_Grass, .pred_Normal, .pred_Water, .pred_Psychic)

augment(final_fit, new_data = df_test) %>%
  roc_curve(type_1, .pred_Bug, .pred_Fire, .pred_Grass, .pred_Normal, .pred_Water, .pred_Psychic) %>%
  autoplot()
```

# Exercise 9
```{r}
data <- data.frame(sample(x = c(1, 0), prob = c(0.421, 0.579), size = 801, replace = TRUE))
data

fg_boot <- bootstraps(data, times = 1e3, apparent = TRUE)
```
